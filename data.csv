Abhijñānashākuntala = Abhignana sakuntalam = The Recognition of Śakuntalā = Shakuntala: A sanskrit drama, Kalidas, KālidāsaThe Recognition of Shakuntala, or The Sign of Shakuntala, is a Sanskrit play by the ancient Indian poet Kālidāsa, dramatizing the story of Shakuntala told in the epic Mahabharata. It is considered to be the best of Kālidāsa's works. Its date is uncertain, but Kālidāsa is often placed in the period between the 1st century BCE and 4th century CE.In Hindu mythology, Shakuntala is the wife of Dushyanta and the mother of Emperor Bharata. Her story is told in the Mahabharata and dramatized by many writers, the most famous adaption being Kalidasa's play Abhijñānaśākuntala (The Sign of Shakuntala).The poem Shakuntella, or Shakontala, is the most beautiful work of Kalidasa, the famous poet and playwright of ""Ancient India"", in Sanskrit. The Indians call it Nakata. Kalidasa lived during the reign of Doshiant Gupta.Shakuntella means ""raised chicken"", is the name of a unique charming girl, who was raised as a child, in the shelter of forest birds, and after a while, in the monastery of a pious man. A meeting takes place between Doshiant, the king of India, and Shakontella, and the two fall in love.The time of the carpenter arrives soon, and after one day has passed, the king of ""Doshiant"" finds the palate, returns to the capital, to take his pregnant wife to his court in all its glory. A girl who has forgotten herself because of love ignores the old age of ""responding to the call"" to which she has set foot, and does not follow the usual rituals and customs.The old man is angry with ""Shakontella"", and opens his mouth to say, ""May the eternal curse be upon you, I look that you have fallen in love, I hope your heart will never remember you, and you will burn in the flames of his shame ...""تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و یکم ماه دسامبر سال 1970میلادیعنوان: شکونتلا؛ اثر: کالیداس؛ مترجم: ایندوشیکهر؛ تهران، بنگاه ترجمه و نشر کتاب؛ 1341؛ در 171ص؛ فروست ادبیات خارجی زیر نظر احسان یارشاطر 45؛ بارها چاپ شده، چاپ دیگر تهران، علمی فرهنگی، 1382، شابک 9644453948؛ چاپ بعدی 1391؛ شابک 9789644453946؛ موضوع نمایشنامه های سنسکریت نویسندگان هندو - اساطیر هند - نمایشنامه شکونتلا - بین سده نخست پیش از میلاد تا سده ی 4میلادیعنوان: شکونتلا؛ اثر: کالیداس؛ مترجم: علی اصغر حکمت؛ دهلی نو، دانشگاه دهلی؛ 1336؛ در 175ص؛ منظومه‌ ی «شکونتلا»، یا «شاکونتالا»، زیباترین اثر «کالیداس» شاعر، و نمایشنامه نویس نامدار «هند باستان»، به زبان «سانسکریت» است؛ «هندی‌»ها عنوان آن را «ناکاتا» می‌گویند؛ «کالیداس»، در دوران شاه «دوشیانت گوپتا» می‌زیسته است؛ «شکونتلا» یعنی «مرغ پرورده»، نام دختر دلربای بی‌ همتایی است، که در کودکی، در پناه مرغان جنگل، و پس از چندی، در صومعه‌ ی مرد پارسایی، پرورده و بالیده است؛ بین «دوشیانت» پادشاه «هند»، و «شکونتلا»، دیداری دست می‌دهد، و هردو به‌ یکدیگر دل می‌بازند؛ زمان وصال زود فرا می‌رسد، و پس از آن‌که روزگاری به کام دل سپری شد، شاه «دوشیانت» کام یافته، به پایتخت برمی‌گردد، تا همسر باردار خویش را، با شکوه تمام به دربار خویش ببرد؛ دختر که به سبب عشق، خویشتن را نیز از یاد برده، به پیری «مستجاب الدعوه»، که بدان دیار پای نهاده، بی‌اعتنایی می‌کند، و رسم معمول، و آداب را به جای نمی‌آورد؛ پیر به «شکونتلا»، خشم می‌گیرد، و زبان می‌گشاید که «نفرین جاودانی بر تو باد، می‌نگرم که عاشق شده‌ ای، امید دارم دلدارت هرگزی تو را به‌ خاطر نیاورد، و تو در شرار هجران او بسوزی...»؛ شکونتلا، در میان بوته‌ های گل، چنان سرگرم خیال عشق، و عاشقی خویش بوده، که حتی نفرین پیر را نمیشنود؛ اما دیگر یاران او صدای لرزان، و خشم‌ آلود پیر را میشنوند - دختری به پای پیر میافتد، و میگوید «بر این بینوا رحم کن، دریغ است، با نفرینت این شادکامی را از او بگیری...»؛ پیر میگوید «نفرین من تا آن زمان خواهد بود، که دختر، نشانی از معشوق، به وی نشان دهد، آنگاه این نفرین دامان او را، رها خواهد کرد.»؛ نفرین او زنگار فراموشی بر دل شاه مینشاند، چنان‌که چون «شکونتلا» شادمان، و امیدوار به‌ دربار می‌رود، شاه او را نمی‌شناسدشکونتلا، با دیدگان اشکبار میگوید: شهریار من، من «شکونتلا» هستم، دختری که تو به همسری برگزیدی، و حلقه‌ ی مرصع خود را بر انگشتش کردی...؛ و سپس دست لرزان خویش را به جلو میبرد، تا انگشتری را به شاه نشان دهد، اما دریغ، حلقه بر انگشت او نبود، و او آن‌را گم کرده بود، ...؛ کالیداس، «کالیداسا» یا «کالیداسه (به زبان دوانگری به معنای خدمتکار کالی)»، نمایشنامه نویس، و شاعر نامدار کلاسیک سانسکریت «هندو» بوده، سه اثر برجسته‌ ی «مگهادوتا»، «شناخت شکونتلا»، و «کومارسمبوه»، از ایشان به یادگار مانده است؛ دوران زندگانی «کالیداس» آشکار نیست، زیستن ایشان را، بین سده‌ های نخست پیش از میلاد، و سده ی چهارم میلادی، می‌انگارند؛ مردمان «هند» جایگاه «کالیداسا» را در ادب سانسکریت، همپایه با «شکسپیر»، در ادب «انگلیسی» می‌دانند؛ شعرها و نوشته‌ های «کالیداس»، بر پایه ی فلسفه و اسطوره‌ شناسی «هندو» نگاشته شده اند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 05/01/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی

Kalidasa was a great Indian poet and playwright who lived sometime between the 4th and 5th centuries AD during the Gupta dynasty. It was a time of prosperity and flourishing of arts and letters.The work entitled ""The Recognition of Sakudala"" is a combination of dialogues and songs, written partly in Sanskrit and partly in the simple, colloquial known as Prakrit. The main plot is based on a story that can be found in the Indian epic Mahabharata, Shakuntala's love affair with King Dushyanta (Dushyanda).Ο Kalidasa υπήρξε σπουδαίος Ινδός ποιητής και δραματουργός που έζησε κάπου ανάμεσα στον 4ο και 5ο μΧ αιώνα, την εποχή της δυναστείας των Gupta. Πρόκειται για μια εποχής ευημερίας και άνθισης των τεχνών και των γραμμάτων. Όπως αναφέρεται και στην εισαγωγή της συγκεκριμένης έκδοσης:""Το βασίλειο περιελάμβανε ολόκληρη την κοιλάδα του Ινδού στα δυτικά, έφτανε ως την Myanmar στην Ανατολή, το Νεπάλ στον Βορρά και στο Νότο έφτανε ως τον ποταμό Narmada. Πρωτεύουσά του ήταν η πόλη Ujjain. Την εποχή εκείνη σημειώθηκε μια οργανωμένη προσπάθεια αναβίωσης του βεδικού παρελθόντος, στα λατρευτικά έθιμα αλλά και στη χρήση της σανσκριτικής γλώσσας [...] Πρόκειται κατά την άποψη πολλών ερευνητών για μια Ινδική Χρυσή Εποχή [...] Μια ευημερούσα χώρα με σωστή διακυβέρνηση, ωραίες πόλεις, νοσοκομεία και πανεπιστήμια. Οι κάτοικοι διαθέτουν ελευθερία στις μετακινήσεις τους, δεν υπόκεινται σε σωματικές τιμωρίες, οι δημόσιοι λειτουργοί έχουν σταθερούς μισθούς [...] ένας ευτυχισμένος τόπος όχι μόνο για το ιερατείο και τους αυλικούς ποιητές αλλά και για τον λαό εξίσου"". Το έργο με τίτλο ""Η Αναγνώριση της Σακούνταλα"" απαρτίζεται από έναν συνδυασμό διαλόγων και τραγουδιών, γραμμένων εν μέρει στα σανσκριτικά και εν μέρει στην απλή, λαϊκή καθομιλουμένη, γνωστή ως Prakrit. Η υπόθεση του έργου είναι παρμένη από μια ιστορία η οποία, εκτός των άλλων, συναντάται και στο ινδικό έπος Mahabharata. Μέσα σε επτά θεατρικές πράξεις εκτυλίσσεται η ερωτική ιστορία της Shakuntala (Σακούνταλα) με τον βασιλιά Dushyanta (Ντουσιάντα). Η νέα είναι είναι θετή κόρη του ερημίτη Kashyapa (ο αληθινός πατέρας της είναι ο βασιλιάς Kaushika και μητέρα της είναι η νύμφη - apsaras - Menaka). Ζει σε ένα ειδυλλιακό μοναστήρι - ερημητήριο, κοντά στον ποταμό Malini, στους πρόποδες την Ιμαλαΐων. Το όνομά της κατά μία εκδοχή σημαίνει ""πουλάκι"" καθώς όταν την βρήκε, βρέφος, εγκαταλειμμένο στο δάσος, ο ερημίτης, τα πουλιά (sakunta) την προστάτευαν από τα άγρια θηρία. Η κοπέλα μεγαλώνει ανάμεσα σε σοφούς και καλόκαρδους ανθρώπους, σε ένα δάσος όπου απαγορεύεται το κυνήγι των ζώων - η ίδια εμφανίζεται να έχει υιοθετήσει ένα ορφανό ελαφάκι - μια ωραία και αγνή κόρη σε έναν τόπο που επικρατεί η γαλήνη και η ομορφιά:""Κάτω από τα δέντρα φυτρώνουνκαρποί από άγριο ρύζι, φερμένοι από τα ράμφη των παπαγάλων που φωλιάζουν στα δέντρα,κι αλλού βλέπει κανείς πέτρες που λαμποκοπούναπό τα έλαια των καρπών ινγκούντι. Τα ελαφάκια είναι τόσο άφοβα που τους μιλάςκαι δεν δείχνουν το ελάχιστο ξάφνιασματα μονοπάτια και οι λιμνούλες φέρουν σημάδιααπό τα βρεγμένα ενδύματα, τα καμωμένα από φλοιούς δέντρωνπου φορούν οι μοναχοί"".Ο βασιλιάς την συναντά την ώρα που ποτίζει τα δέντρα, μαζί με τις δύο πιστές της φίλες και μέσα από μια ιδιαίτερα χαριτωμένη σκηνή, όπου μια μέλισσα επιτίθεται στο κορίτσι κι εκείνος σπεύδει να τη βοηθήσει, γίνεται η πρώτη τους γνωριμία. Ο έρωτάς τους ολοκληρώνεται μέσα από ένα είδος γάμου που βασίζεται στην συναινετική ερωτική συνεύρεση, λέγεται gandharva και είναι απολύτως αποδεκτός από την ινδουϊστική θρησκεία.Όταν ο βασιλιάς υποχρεώνεται να εγκαταλείψει το μοναστήρι, της υπόσχεται πως σύντομα θα στείλει να την φέρουν κοντά του:""Μία - μία, κάθε μέρα,μέτρα κι από μία συλλαβή του ονόματός μου.Όταν θα έχεις φτάσει στην τελευταία, αγάπη μου,ένας απεσταλμένος μου θα έρθει να σε οδηγήσει και να σε φέρει στο παλάτι,εκεί που ζουν οι βασιλικές μου σύζυγοι"" Μέσα στην ερωτική της μελαγχολία, η Shakuntala, η οποία έχει μείνει έγκυος, παραβλέπει να ασκήσει τους κανόνες τις φιλοξενίας, αγνοώντας την παρουσία ενός πολύ διακεκριμένου προσώπου με μαγικές δυνάμεις, πρόκειται για τον προφήτη ή μάντη Durvasas, ο οποίος ρίχνει επάνω της μια κατάρα: Να την ξεχάσει αυτός τον οποίο εκείνη σκέφτεται. Και μόνο μετά από τα παρακάλια των φιλενάδων της ο Durvasas ελαφρύνει την κατάρα του με ένα όρο: Τα μάγια θα λυθούν μόλις ο αγαπημένος της αντικρίσει το σύμβολο της αγάπης τους. Πρόκειται για ένα δαχτυλίδι που φέρει την σφραγίδα του.Κάπως έτσι ξεκινά για την ηρωίδα μια θλιβερή περιπέτεια, μια φοβερή δοκιμασία. Η οποία ωστόσο θα έχει αίσια έκβαση. Μέσα από διάφορα σημεία του έργου παρουσιάζονται ορισμένοι θεσμοί και κοινωνικές αντιλήψεις πάνω στις οποίες βασίζεται ο συγκεκριμένος πολιτισμός της εποχής του Kalidasa. Πάνω από όλα υπάρχουν οι κάστες που καθορίζουν τη θέση και το επάγγελμα ενός ανθρώπου:""Λένε πως όποιο κι αν είναι το κληρονομικό επάγγελμα του καθένα,αυτό είναι υποχρεωμένος να ασκείακόμα κι αν το απεχθάνεται.Ένας μορφωμένος Βραχμάνος, γεμάτος συμπόνιαείναι υποχρεωμένος να σκοτώνει ζώαγια τις λατρευτικές θυσίες"". Η πολυγαμία αποτελεί προνόμιο του βασιλιά (ισχύει και για άλλα μέλη των ευπορότερων κοινωνικών στρωμάτων) κι ανάμεσα στις βασιλικές συζύγους, η πρώτη που θα φέρει στον κόσμο ένα αρσενικό παιδί, έχει την υψηλότερη θέση ανάμεσα στις άλλες, καθώς ο μικρός της ορίζεται ως διάδοχος του βασιλικού θρόνου. Ο ρόλος και η συμπεριφορά μιας καλής συζύγου ορίζεται από συγκεκριμένους κανόνες:""Να υπακούς τους μεγαλύτερούς σουνα είσαι καλή με τις άλλες συζύγους του άνδρα σου.Αν αυτός σε προσβάλει να μην του αντιμιλήσεις με οργή.Πάντα να είσαι ευγενική με τους υπηρέτες να μην κομπάζεις για την ευτυχία σου. Με αυτόν το τρόπο τα νέα κορίτσια γίνονται οι Κυρίες ενός σπιτιού.Όσες δεν τηρούν του κανόνεςφέρνουν δυστυχία στο σπιτικό"".Από την άλλη, αν και δεν δίνει πολλά στοιχεία για αυτές, ο βασιλιάς διαθέτει στον στρατό του ένα επίλεκτο γυναικείο σώμα από πολεμίστριες. Πρόκειται για τις Yavanani ή γυναίκες της Ιωνίας, οι οποίες φέρουν τόξα και προέρχονται από μέρη που παλαιότερα αποτελούσαν τμήμα των ελληνιστικών βασιλείων. Το κείμενο αισθητικά, διέπεται από έναν ιδιαίτερο αισθησιασμό. Πίσω από τις τρυφερές στιχομυθίες του νεαρού ζευγαριού, παρουσιάζεται ένα παθιασμένο ερωτικό παιχνίδι, μια μύηση στις χαρές και τις απολαύσεις της σεξουαλικής πράξης, όπως αυτή εκδηλώνεται μέσα από τρυφερές χειρονομίες, φλογερές ματιές, στιγμιαία αγγίγματα, λόγια και εκφράσεις που εκφράζουν μια έντονη ερωτική έλξη. Aπό μία παράσταση της Λήδας Shantala, που ανέβηκε στην Αθήνα το 1991, πληροφορίες και ένα ενδιαφέρον βίντεο με ένα χορευτικό απόσπασμα από το έργο:http://www.shantala.gr/x_shakunthala0...

Johnson, which I read the first time, does a better job conveying the romance of Dushyanta and Sakuntala's forest encounter, but the Arthur W.

I first read Sakuntala in 2009, when I was a teacher's assistant to a university course on ""Masterworks of World Literature."" I think the translation by W.J. Johnson, which I read the first time, does a better job conveying the romance of Dushyanta and Sakuntala's forest encounter, but the Arthur W. Ryder translation, which I read the second time, helps the play feel weightier, like a Greek epic. Anyway, I continue to marvel at this story of the conflicts between duty and pleasure, nature and nurture. I am teaching my own college-level course on world literature in a couple of months, and this is the text we're starting with. A beautiful, joyful, timeless classic.My original review (2009):The story is maddeningly simple: While hunting, King Dusyanta wanders into an ascetic commune, sees a beautiful woman (Sakuntala), promises to make her first amongst his wives, impregnates her, returns to his palace and, through an inconvenient curse, he forgets all about her. Years pass, the curse is reversed, he realizes his mistake, and he pines to find and claim his lost wife Sakuntala. You've probably already guessed the ending, but in case your imagination is creaky today, I'll give you a hint: This story is a comedy.Sakuntala, or The Recognition of Sakuntala, or Sakuntala and the Ring of Recognition, or however else it has been translated, is from my perspective chauvinistic, elitist and classist. This may be more a problem with my perspective than the text -- the play was written some 1700 years ago and by/for a culture about which I am absolutely clueless. Yet despite my horror at the playwright's politics, I couldn't help but find passion and beauty in his language and imagery. The metaphor of the husband as mango tree, the wife (wives?) as the vines that encircle and bejewel it, is sexist, absolutely -- but in its way it is also gorgeous.In American schools we study many (ideologically flawed) pieces of drama -- Sophocles, Shakespeare, Arthur Miller, etc. -- but what of the dramatic and literary traditions of non-Western societies? Given its prominence in India (and other pockets of Asia), why is Kalidasa a name so few people here have heard? I saw my first Bollywood movie when I was an undergraduate, and it was one of the weirdest, most unsettling cinematic experiences I had had to that point. Why am I just learning now that joyous wedding-planning, exaggerated emotional performances, last-minute divine interventions and spontaneous eruptions into song actually have long traditions in Indian literature?Again, I conclude a ""masterwork"" of world literature with mixed thoughts: (1) This play is wonderful. (2) Why the hell haven't I read it before?

And my first and only reading of Shakuntala was one of them.

4,"The French Academy can take the Three unities and stuff them. What is this marvel? In the fifth century AD, a time when theatre was barely accepted in Europe solely for marketing Christianity purposes, we have a story of drama, crushed hopes, joyful reunions, curses, magic bracelets, nymphs and out-of-stage sex. Patriarchal values aside, this piece is particularly rich and enchanting in comparison with the Greek, Roman formality, before, and French, afterwards. Charming!"

I was also not very impressed with king Dushyanta's love for Śakuntalā. (view spoiler)[He takes one look at her and declares that she is the one and only, whereas he has a harem full of women to whom he has probably said the same thing in the past. In fact, two of them are mentioned by name and they appear unhappy because Dushyanta does not pay attention to them anymore. So Śakuntalā will very likely not be the last of his conquests.(And the less said about how he treats her in the Mahābhārata, the better!) (hide spoiler)]But I am glad to have finally read it*, so I can make room on my shelves for something else.*Thanks to a challenge in the Netherlands & Flanders group, where I also left a short review in Dutch.

6,"Sanskrit is a hard language to crack, and, from my experience, even harder to translate.

This is not to say that the play is easy to read--the Gupta-era aesthetic is much different than that of say Sophocles or Shakespeare. Vasudev provides a useful introdution that succincly explains Sanskrit terminology like rasa, etc.

First written in Sanskrit.A mixture of Hindu thought and mythology.By one of this continents greatest poets, Kalidasa.A love story; a King and a hermit girl.A long time ago (500 a.c.e.) Only the scenery has changed.What was, is. What will be, happened.Delightful.Absolutely delightful.(3.5*)"

But in the end, I am slightly disappointed that Shakuntala didn’t pull a Sita and refuse to go back with Dushyanta.The translation was easy to read but saying it is a twenty-first century translation is not an excuse to dump a bunch of heys and okays into an ancient work. It is clunky and it is, to me - I grew up listening to Sanskrit verses - evident that it doesn’t flow like Sanskrit verse. The translator just doesn’t let proper nouns just be. He translated the name of a deer as Baby Long Eyes, at which point I just went ...you took your role as translator too far.

The father of the main character also appears in the other great epic, Ramayana. The plot is about love reciprocated, rejected, mourned and recovered. Curiously enough, it makes clear that Hindu asceticism did not tend to promote humility, but pride, as indicated by the ease with which a Hindu holy man (who not even appears on stage) consideres himself mistreated by Shakuntala because she was preoccupied thinking about her love, and did not receive him properly. The holy man's curse causes all the subsequent misfortunes in the play.

15,"It was a wonderful read, but I was expecting more erotic tensions between Dusyanta and Sakuntala. The book is sufficiently supported with references, notes and further reading. Being one of the widely read stories, I think it has been a little toned down on the erotic part. I have heard my friends tell me that it is little more aesthetically erotic in the original and Bengali versions."
16,"A good edition and readable translation, with helpful notes and an adequate introduction summarizing the historical context of the play in Sanskrit literature and the current scholarship on its aesthetics (very well referenced!)."
17,"This was a fun play. Mystical elements of Indian culture, along with brief cameos of gods and goddesses throughout, all intertwined in a love story. It was fairly easy to read, yet enjoyable for what it is"
18,"A beautiful love story along the lines of a Greek epic. This was a great translation. A beautiful young woman and young king fall in love, get married, but then get cursed so that the king forgets his wife until the spell is broken."
19,"A cute and rather enjoyable old play. The plot and love story seems predictable today, but that's probably because this was the mold.

I've read Śakuntalā in the translation of Chandra Rajan.A play told as if it were a fairytale. A fairytale told as if it were a poem. Śakuntalā has been widely considered Kalidasa's ultimate achievement and rightly so. It is a play of wonders, of colourful larger-than-life characters and whimsical scenery. It's above all a joyous read, as most Kalidasa is. This is one of those works that you read with a grin on your face the whole way through, even at its most tragic, simply because it's so beautiful. Kalidasa is a master of colours, images, sounds, and he uses them skillfully here to tell his simple yet resonant story.You may know what Śakuntalā is about even if you haven't read the previous incarnations of the story (most notably in the Mahabharata). There's an otherworldly princess, there's a mighty king, they flirt, they fall in love, they are separated, they suffer, they are finally reunited. Its the kind of old fairytale we are used to, the one we were read when we were children. Kalidasa makes this story feel new and young again. For starters, the big cast of characters is unforgettable: the heroine's sidekicks, the pious men in all their variations, the evil sorcerer (sort of), even a witty jester which predates Shakespeare for like a millenium. Those characters provide the colour, a colour mimicked by Kalidasa's evocative words.Śakuntalā is gorgeous, cute, perhaps too cute, religious, spiritual, whimsical, the kind of book that makes you feel like a young reader again. Don't we live for that kind of wide-eyed wonder?

The first time I read this enormously enchanting play was way back in 2002. The attractiveness of verse, the sleek use of defined phrases and the combination of lofty idiom coupled with a never-before portrayal of human emotion has never left me since. Thematic component is an indispensable constituent in a literary subject. It is, ordinarily, a foremost appeal of the said topic. If truth be told, every litterateur places a ‘premise’ in their literary subject to shed light on a particular aspect. Kalidasa, has shown his world-class aptitude in the matter of presenting a theme in ‘The Recognition of Sakuntala’. Centering the characters of Dusyanta and Sakuntala, the dramatist has made ‘love’ the most potent theme here. The setting is marked by the beauties of the wooded Himalayan foothills, where the youthful hermitage-dwelling girl, Shakuntala, is enamoured with King Dusyanta. As the action expands—Shakuntala and the King falling in love, being disconnected by a curse, and in due course coming together, after years of anguish-filled pondering.

In this case a curse prevents Sakuntalas beloved from granting her proper recognition. This is resolved eventually. How the King treats her after making love to her is directly related to her family's view as well as societys view. This is considered a classic of world literature so I'm glad to have finally read it.

26,"A charming little play, with some great roles. A few iffy bits though, where the 'secret marriage' implies her being knocked up, but that's all 1000+ year old cultural nuances I don't know about. By far the best part are the endless streams of poetry, almost all concerning love, and several passages which are truly, truly beautiful.Well worth a read, and apparently Goethe ripped off the beginning for Faust.

27,"Read for my World Drama class. I really enjoyed this! It is full of romance, drama, beautiful writing and a compelling story overall. The foot notes located at the back of the book really helped contextualize some of the translations, as I am unfamiliar with Hindu ideology. However, this play has definitely increased my interest in learning more about Hindu mythology. I am really happy I got to read this!"
28,"Though classist and sexist, this erotic play greatly extends a scene in the excellent Mahabharata. While the story is quite simple, the use of language is quite fascinating. I would love to see this performed in person -- it would do greatly to enhance the intended mood -- rather than simply read it."
29,I seldom read drama for I get impatient in completing them but this turned out to be an amazing read. The best part was knowing the issues of ancient Indian society. Not only does the drama reflect upon the Indian society but also it is extremely poetical and musical that makes it even more interesting.
30,"This is a great classic, but at the same time a very modern tale of a rather naive woman conned and abandonned whilst pregnant -how she battles through and never gives up. I enjoyed it a great deal even if the happy ending is a bit incredible. Do not be put off by the fact that it was written so long ago. It has retained its freshness and beauty."
31,"”Having passed by a river full of water,I’m longing now for an empty mirage.”
Beautiful prose for the more whimsical and poetic sections wherein the connection between human beings and nature was developed. Love at first sight, king of a palace and sage’s daughter of a hermitage, a curse, the following misunderstandings, and a happy ending!"
32,"The language painted some delightful scenes in the garden. The quick love and seduction between the two main character seems a little weird, but they are both meant to be virtuous and represent something more than just two people. It is an interesting arc."

The Recognition of Shakuntala by KalidasaThere is a list of books that we should try to read, because they are supposed to be the best ever written. You can find the list on my blog somewhere, but easier to find would be the Guardian site.I am not sure though that it is the Guardian who actually compiled it, for I think I have read somewhere that it was first put together in Scandinavia, with critics, writers and scholars. One name I remember is Umberto Ecco, who supposedly took part in the selection process.The list is definitely interesting, even if it feels that efforts have been made to go around the globe in an effort to be as impartial as possible. Another explanation might be that those consulted in various parts of the world emphasized their own productions.No matter what the politics were, Shakuntala is on that list and therefore it got my attention.It’s not bad and I have to be careful with the label, because I only had the chance to listen to a theatrical, adapted version of the Indian original.The atmosphere of the play is interesting, with some specific “sounds and music”. The actors seem to speak like in Slumdog Millionaire (a film that I hated, although I had loved the director’s Trainspotting and Shallow Grave).The “action” seems to be somewhat usual; nothing extraordinary seems to happen up to a point. There is a prince who falls for a young maiden, gives her a marvelous ring for a gift and his heart.About the heart we begin to have doubts and refer to the title, when The Recognition of Shakuntala...well, fails to happen:The family is gathered at the palace to give as a bride, the daughter who had been promised the moon and the sky, by a ruler who seems to have second thoughts.The mighty prince says he does not recognize the bride to be.What I found likeable and interesting was the fact that the mother is not insulting the majestic ruler, but is not overwhelmed either, keeps her pride throughout.But when it comes to showing proof, the ring is no longer on the finger.An adviser recommends a kind of a stalemate, with time and a special event showing later if the young woman is the bride destined for such a noble prince.Things turn a bit nasty, but to make you enjoy the tale I will stop somewhere in the middle of the plot.I am not sure about the unabridged version, but the play I listen to more than satisfies any interest I could have in Shakuntala. Even if seriously enticed by the Eastern culture and in particular Buddhism, I also have a kind of weariness, a suspicion of India. When I heard someone I know that she wants to go to India, I was shocked and remembered the Seinfeld episodes where they travel to India and the idea is to delay using the bathroom until…they reach home again.I rest easy and assured that I will never have the pleasure and maybe the inconvenience of visiting that subcontinent, for better or worse.www.realini.blogspot.ro

On the other hand, I want to take a step back and look at it through the lens of history, and take the time to consider the caste system and the intentions of plays as described in the introduction. So. Dilemma.In the end, I'm just stuck giving this four stars. Why? Because compromise.From my normal standpoint: 3 stars. I enjoyed this thoroughly, and some of the language was eminently beautiful (and ridiculously quotable), but the characters are 2D at best and the plot is both trite and predictable. It's a cute enough story and good entertainment, but it doesn't hold my kind of depth.From a more literary standpoint: 4.5-5 stars. Khalidasa, you have succeeded in your intentions (she says to the realllyyyy dead guy). If the wording and imagery in this play are beautiful in English, I can only imagine what they're like in their original Sanskrit and Pankrit. Imagining the performances that would go along with the dialogue is at turns breathtaking and hilarious, and I think that, if there was an opportunity to see this play as it was meant to be done, I would not be disappointed.And there you have it. Now I'm going to sleep so I don't pass out in biostats tomorrow.

Sakuntala is a huge cultural influence of India written by Kalidasa. This work's brilliance lies in the small poems that the characters use as a means of expressing themselves, or any critical viewpoint of the story (or just for descriptive purposes). Sakuntala, for me, was worth reading only because of the well-translated poems of Kalidasa's thinking. The entire play is about being joined, then separated, and then again joined. That's simple enough. But the philosophy behind it is: it is like that in everyday life. I will not explain what I am saying, for Kalidasa does it well enough.The plot and the characters were okay. King Dusyanta (the protagonist) was removed of any unethical actions caused by himself and himself only (unlike in the Mahabharta, from which the play was inspired.) This made the characters a bit 2-D, having them be 'the most ethical king!' and 'the most innocent girl!' Kalidasa also uses nature as a huge literary agent to help him in his metaphors and thoughts. The use of nature is widely prevalent in Indian Literature. All in all, it was an enjoyable read. And could be reread, focusing on the poems more than the actual plot and characters because they don't really deserve a second read.

There are many songs and speeches that I’m sure are beautiful in performance, but only add tangentially to the main story. And despite the characters being a bit flat and stiff, we have empathy for them. Since I don’t know the cosmology of this world, there may be deeper meanings and themes in this play, but I didn’t see them. It seems that the primary goal of the play to entertain with story, dance and song, and in that it succeeded. This isn’t for the average reader.

It seems arbitrary and forced as a plot device."

73,"A beautiful play, much more pleasing than the story in the Mahābhārata. It is also interesting to see a king who is actually a kind, humble man."
74,Definitely a classic.
75,"Myth, love, gods and emotions woven together in great poetry by the Indian bard."
76,"Written in 400 A.D., this drama is an absolutely lovely combination of prose and poetry, humans and gods, and spirituality and sensuality. It really is all about love, is it not? Such a pleasure!"
77,It was very melodramatic. It was like reading an ancient transcript of Bollywood!
78,The Recognition of Śakuntalā. #Kālidāsa An interpretation of the Shakuntala myth reflects the values of Classical #India. #gender & #casteReviewed @reallyReads
79,"Some really extraordinary poetry and a quite fascinating act structure. The introduction was fantastic, and really helped me to understand how to go about reading my first ever Sanskrit play."
80,Keenly waiting for the bollywood version with SRK-- we all know its coming.
81,c. 400
82,"Intriguing. A bit alien. That's good, BTW.

84,"A classic, obviously, and a special-interest read. I was interested and I read."
85,"I remember reading this way back in 2014 during my tradition in playwriting class. That class was quite early in the morning, everyone's heads were still sluggish with lack of sleep but I clearly remember being fascinated with the story itself. A lot of stuff didn't make sense to me - the decisions made by the characters, etc - but it was pretty good.

87,Its a good read. Its more of a short skit or a short story. Although Johnson has translated very vividly but some portions feel a little bit bland. Was good for company during a boring flight.
88,"The Recognition of Sakuntala, by Kalidasa, is a resplendent tale of love, loss, confusion, and reunion. The imagery and figurative language are palpable. I'd love to see this play performed. The included verse version of Sakuntala helpfully enlarges the world. Here's one of my favorite passages from the play. The king is speaking to Sakuntala, ""Limbs cushioned on flowers --Bruised lotuses, fragrantBut listless with pain --Should conserve their powers,And treat stale custom with proper disdain.""
